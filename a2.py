    There are at least 2 ways to approach this. One way is to count
    the number of characters that are not nucleotides and then at the
    end check whether there were more than zero. Another way is to use
    a Boolean variable that represents whether you have found a
    non-nucleotide character; it would start off as True and would be
    set to False if you found something that wasn't an 'A', 'T', 'C'
    or 'G'.
    You should construct examples that contain only 'A's, 'T's, 'C's
    and 'G's, and you should also create examples that contain other
    characters. A string is not a valid DNA sequence if it contains
    lowercase letters.
